/**
 *
 *<b>Responsibilities</b>
 *<pre>
 * StatefulKnowledgeSession management
 *   - implementations of this interface manage the lifecycle of one or more org.drools.runtime.StatefulKnowledgeSession objects
 *   - these StatefulKnowledgeSession objects implement org.drools.runtime.process.ProcessRuntime
 *   - subsequently, this interface exposes various ProcessRuntime derived operations as an EJB 'service'
 *   - ksessionId state :
 *      - some of the methods exposed by this interface take both a 'processInstanceId' and a  'ksessionId' as a parameter
 *      - the 'ksessionId' is optional depending on several considerations:
 *          - for an implementation that only maintains one StatefulKnowledgeSession (ie: similar to CommandDelegate of jbpm5 gwt-console-server)
 *            the ksessionId is irrelevant
 *          - for an implementation that assigns a StatefulKnowledgeSession to a single process instance or a group of process instances,
 *            that implementation should maintain a mapping of ksessionIds to processInstanceIds.  If null is passed to any of the methods
 *            accepting a ksessionId, then the implementation should execute a lookup for ksessionId.
 *
 * KnowledgeBase management
 *   - implementations of this interface will typically manage the lifecycle of an org.drools.KnowledgeBase
 *   - an implementation will use this KnowledgeBase object to create/load the runtime StatefulKnowledgeSession objects
 *   - the KnowledgeBase object is a repository of all knowledge definitions to include :  rules, processes, functions and type models
 *   - this KnowledgeBase object is typically kept current by interacting with a remote BRMS guvnor service
 *   - the remote BRMS guvnor service is the actual 'system-of-record' of knowledge definitions
 *
 * Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) audit logging
 *   - implementations of this may or may not feed a BAM data warehouse of process instance events
 *</pre>
